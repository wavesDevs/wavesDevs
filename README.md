👋 Hey there! I'm Robert, a software engineer from Miami, Florida. Since a young child, I have always been passionate about problem solving and learning (particularly in STEM disciplines), which made pursuing technology the clear choice. I recently graduated from Florida International University with a degree in Computer Science, which I hope to use to create truly innovative solutions to the most challenging problems in our society!
